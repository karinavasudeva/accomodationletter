  const prompt = `For a person with the following disability: "${disability}" in a ${context} context, provide EXACTLY 10 accommodations. Focus on accommodations that:

                1. Are supported by research or best practices 
                2. Directly address core challenges associated with the disability
                3. Are implementable at an institutional level (and not just advice for the individual)
                4. Are accommodations people already use and find helpful

                Consider accommodations in, but not limited to, these categories:
                - Academic/Work Environment Modifications
                - Technological Aids
                - Assessment and Evaluation Adjustments

                - Time Management and Organization Assistance
                - Priority registration for courses
                - Flexibility with deadlines and provide extended time for exams if needed.

                Avoid generic, potentially stigmatizing, or personal advice suggestions. Be extensive. Ensure accommodations are appropriate for being requested from an institution.

                Provide your response as a JSON array of exactly 10 objects, where each object has a single key "accommodation" with a string value describing one accommodation. For example:
                [
                  {"accommodation": "Provide access to a quiet, distraction-reduced testing environment for exams and assessments."},
                  {"accommodation": "Allow the use of noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs during lectures and study sessions to reduce auditory distractions."},
